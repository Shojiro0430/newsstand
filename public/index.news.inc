    Thanks to generous patrons, we met our first funding goal and were able to remove Google AdSense ads!<p>
    As we work toward transitioning payments from Paypal to Patreon, soon you'll be able to link your Patreon account to your TUJ account, so your support on Patreon will trigger paid subscription benefits here.<p>
    Please check out our Patreon for more information: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/erorus"><img src="https://everynothing.net/patronButton.png" alt="Become a Patron!" style="vertical-align:middle;" width="154" height="31" border="0"></a>
