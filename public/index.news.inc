    Please participate in the <a href="http://thegoldencrusade.net/survey/">2015 World of Warcraft Gold Survey</a>.
    <blockquote>
        <p>Every year (or thereabouts, 2014 was skipped), the survey provides insight into what kind of gold levels players keep, as well as some demographic information. Thousands of players respond each year, with a record of 11,344 set in 2012.</p>
        <p>For those unfamiliar with the survey, it is a quick 2-3 minute survey that asks you some background questions (how long you've been playing, what you like to do in game, etc.), and how much gold you have across all players. This year the survey runs through the 4th of December closing at midnight, and results will be released the following week.</p>
        <p>For more information, including past results and a F.A.Q., check out <a href="http://thegoldencrusade.net/world-of-warcraft-wealth-survey/">the host's page on the World of Warcraft Gold Survey</a>.</p>
