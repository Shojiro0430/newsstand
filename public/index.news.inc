    <p>Our ISP is investigating an issue which is affecting the delivery of notification emails to our subscribers. At
        this time, some users may not receive their notifications via email, and we may remove some email addresses
        from TUJ subscriber accounts when the notifications bounce back to us.</p>

    <p>We hope this issue will be resolved soon and will keep you updated with any developments. In the meantime,
        subscribers can always find their notifications in the box at the top of their
        <a href="#subscription">subscription page</a>. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
