                <h2>What is this I don't even</h2>
                <ul class="faq">
                    <li><b>What is a WoW Token?</b> The WoW Token is an item in World of Warcraft.</li>
                    <li><b>What do I do with it?</b> There are <b>only two things</b> you can do with a WoW Token:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Buy one with money from the in-game Shop, then sell it in the Auction House for gold.</li>
                            <li>Buy one with gold from the Auction House, then use it to add 30 days of game time to your subscription.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>How much money does it cost?</b> You buy it from the in-game shop.
                        <ul>
                            <li>North America: $20 USD</li>
                            <li>Europe: &euro;20 EUR or &pound;15 GBP</li>
                            <li>China: &yen;30 CNY</li>
                            <li>Taiwan: NT$500 TWD</li>
                            <li>South Korea: &#8361;22,000 KRW</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>How much gold does it cost?</b> It varies over time (that's what this site is for), but the cost is the same for every realm in your region, from Aegwynn to Zuluhed. I'll say that again. <b>It costs the same on every realm.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Can I buy it with money then use it myself?</b> No, you can only sell that one on the Auction House. Plus, that would be dumb, it would be the most expensive way to add game time. If you want game time for money, <a href="https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time">buy game time directly</a>.</li>
                    <li><b>Can I buy one to give to a friend?</b> No, like it says up there, either buy one with money and sell it for gold, or buy one with gold and use it yourself. That's it.</li>
                    <li><b>Can I buy one with gold and resell it later?</b> No, all you can do are those 2 things mentioned above. That's it. Blizzard locked this thing down. Don't overcomplicate this.</li>
                    <li><b>I don't have a sub right now, but I know I have the gold.</b> Just log in to the game, and on the character select screen, there's someplace to buy a token and use the gold from your characters.</li>
                    <li><b>I'm still confused. Can you run me through that again?</b> Try reading <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/guides/wow-token">Wowhead's guide</a> about the WoW Token.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>TL;DR</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The WoW Token is an in-game item.</li>
                    <li>You can buy one from Blizzard for $20, &euro;20, &pound;15, CN&yen;30, NT$500, or &#8361;22,000 and sell it in the AH.</li>
                    <li>You can buy one in the AH and use it for 30 days of game time.</li>
                    <li>The gold price is the same for all realms, and is shown in the charts on this site.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A maximum of 10 Tokens per week may be purchased for real money from the in-game Shop, to be sold on the Auction House for gold.</li>
                    <li>A maximum of 36 Tokens every 24 months may be purchased for gold via the Auction House, to be used for game time.</li>
                    <li>Players may only have one type of Token in their inventory at one time. If any character on a Battle.net account is currently holding a Token purchased from the in-game Shop, that player will not be able to purchase a Token from the Auction House. Likewise, if any character is holding a Token purchased from the Auction House, that player will not be able to purchase a Token from the in-game Shop.</li>
                    <li>Players may hold a maximum of 10 Tokens in their inventory at one time. This limit is shared across all characters on the Battle.net account.</li>
                </ul>

                Please participate in the <a href="http://thegoldencrusade.net/survey/">2015 World of Warcraft Gold Survey</a>.
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Every year (or thereabouts, 2014 was skipped), the survey provides insight into what kind of gold levels players keep, as well as some demographic information. Thousands of players respond each year, with a record of 11,344 set in 2012.</p>
                    <p>For those unfamiliar with the survey, it is a quick 2-3 minute survey that asks you some background questions (how long you've been playing, what you like to do in game, etc.), and how much gold you have across all players. This year the survey runs through the 4th of December closing at midnight, and results will be released the following week.</p>
                    <p>For more information, including past results and a F.A.Q., check out <a href="http://thegoldencrusade.net/world-of-warcraft-wealth-survey/">the host's page on the World of Warcraft Gold Survey</a>.</p>
